##Ideas
Rules:
- in turn, three cards per player.
- one "shackle" (manilha)

(?)create a list that "save" the 40 cards of truco.
create a function that take the cards of each turn.

list.remove --> could be utilize in moment that player play a card in table. For example, the played card go to the first position
of list, and then, is remove because it was played.

or, I create a list for each player, contained three cards in each list.
However, I think that this idea is "fail" because him don't give me total control for the cards.
